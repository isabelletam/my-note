# My Personal Project: **myNote**

## *What* is myNote?
My application will be a learning aid for people who are currently learning a second language. In my application, 
you will be able to record down the word/grammar you have just studied, its definition, as well as it's type
 (ie. verb, noun, particle etc). 
## *Who* is myNote for?
myNote is for anybody interested in learning any language! Honestly it can even be used for 
memorizing terms for school.
## *Why* this?
 This project is of interest to me because as I have taught myself two languages in the
 past, one of the most annoying things I found was trying to stay organized when learning new grammar or vocabulary.
 My notebook was always an unsorted mess of new entries! 
 Hopefully with this application, I will no longer have to feel that pain. 
## User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to **enter** my *freshly* learned vocabulary.
- As a user, I want to be able to **load** my current list of entries and continue adding to it
- As a user, I want to be able to **practice** my entry by retrieving all previous entries. 
- As a user, I want the ability to **flag** certain vocabulary that I should focus on.
- As a user, I want to be able to save my current list of entries
- As a user, I want to be able to load my current list of entries

## Phase 4: Task 2
- Use of map interface which allows me to map entries to their entry type, with entry types as the key and 
entries as the values

## Phase 4: Task 3
- I wish that I made different classes for making my entry and editing my entries as I think that would make
my code easier to navigate if I was to try editing it or adding to it in the future.
- Create a superclass for my GUI and all my windows as all of my window classes share many similarities. By creating a
superclass, if I were to create new window classes the process would be more efficient as well as once again, would make
my code easier to navigate.
